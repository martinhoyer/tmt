summary: Specify how check result should be interpreted

story:
    As a tester I want to control how the result of individual checks
    affects the overall test result, allowing for expected failures
    or informational checks.

description: |
    Checks can have different impacts on the overall test result.
    The 'result' attribute allows testers to specify how each check's
    result should be interpreted. The following values are supported:

    respect
        check result is respected and affects the overall test result
        (default value)
    xfail
        expected fail (pass when check fails, fail when check passes)
    info
        check result is always treated as "INFO" and does not affect
        the overall test result

    .. versionadded:: 1.38.0

example:
  - |
    # Use the default behavior (respect)
    check:
      - how: avc

  - |
    # Expect the AVC check to fail
    check:
      - how: avc
        result: xfail

  - |
    # Treat the dmesg check as informational only
    check:
      - how: dmesg
        result: info
