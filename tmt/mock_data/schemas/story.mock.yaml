  story: |
    As a tester I want to abort current, and all subsequent,
    test executions using a shell command during test
    execution.
  description: |
    The `tmt-abort` command can be used to abort the current
    test execution. This command together with the
    `rstrnt-abort` and `rhts-abort` aliases provides a
    backward-compatible way to execute tests written for the
    `restraint`__ framework. These scripts are installed on the
    guest and overwrite any existing scripts with the same name.

  title: CLI Help Availability
  description: |

    directly from the command line using the `--help`
    option.

    - tmt run --help
    - tmt test import --help

    There should be a manual page available in the package.
    Man page should contain brief introduction about the tool
    and a list of essential commands and options.
