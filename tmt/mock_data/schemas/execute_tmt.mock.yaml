# Example 1: Minimal tmt executor (most common case)
- how: tmt

# Example 2: tmt executor with exit-first enabled
- how: tmt
  name: exit-first-execution
  exit-first: true

# Example 3: tmt executor with a specific duration for the whole execution phase
- how: tmt
  name: timed-execution-phase
  duration: "2h 30m" # Overall timeout for all tests in this phase

# Example 4: tmt executor with ignore-duration
- how: tmt
  name: ignore-test-durations
  ignore-duration: true
  script: # Example: Run a custom script before tmt executor runs tests
    - "echo 'Starting test execution, test durations will be ignored.'"

# Example 5: tmt executor with restraint-compatible mode
- how: tmt
  name: restraint-mode
  restraint-compatible: true

# Example 6: tmt executor with a custom script to be run by the executor
# (Note: This 'script' is for the tmt executor step itself, not the test script)
- how: tmt
  name: custom-executor-script
  script:
    - "echo 'Performing pre-test actions by execute step script'"
    - "/usr/local/bin/custom_setup_for_tmt_executor.sh"
    - "echo 'Pre-test actions complete'"

# Example 7: tmt executor with 'where' clause (multihost context)
- how: tmt
  name: server-side-execution
  where: server # Runs tests on guests with role 'server'

# Example 8: All boolean options set
- how: tmt
  name: full-options-example
  exit-first: true
  ignore-duration: true # Note: exit-first and ignore-duration might be contradictory in some senses
  restraint-compatible: false # Explicitly false
  duration: "15m" # Overall duration for this specific execution step
  script: "echo 'Executing with all boolean flags set'"
  where:
    - client
    - workstation

# Example 9: Multiple tmt execution blocks (e.g. if a plan has multiple execute steps with 'tmt')
# This would typically be in a plan's execute array, each item is one such block.
# For this mock file, we just list them.
- how: tmt
  name: first-batch-execution
  duration: "1h"
  script: "echo 'Running first batch of tests'"

- how: tmt
  name: second-batch-execution
  exit-first: false # Default
  duration: "30m"
  script: "echo 'Running second batch, allowing all to complete'"
  where: "special_guest_type"

# Example 10: Minimal with a name
- how: tmt
  name: standard-execution
