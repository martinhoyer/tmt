# tmt

Welcome to the Test Management Tool documentation!

The **tmt** python module and command line tool implement the
[specification](spec.md) which allows to store all test metadata
directly within a git repository. It provides an elegant and
comfortable way to manage tests and safely execute them across
different environments.

Check the [Overview](overview.md) to get a high-level summary of
available functionality, follow our [guide](guide.md) which will help
you with the first steps and teach you how to efficiently use the
tool, check out the [stories](stories.md) which motivated the effort,
consult the [specification](spec.md) to get detailed information about
supported features, get inspired by many [examples](examples.md)
demonstrating the usage on real-life scenarios.
